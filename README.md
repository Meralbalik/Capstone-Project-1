The ACT test is designed to assess high school students' general educational development and their ability to complete college-level work. ACT scores are also used to compare schools and districts on the basis of their average score and to evaluate state educational programs. Students can prepare for and take the test several times to attain their desired score.  ACT test covers four subject areas: English, mathematics, reading, and science. Each subject area test receives a score ranging from 1 to 36.</br></br>
In this study, I investigated the factors  related to schoolsâ€™ performance on the ACT. Several datasets were used for the analysis. The ACT data to be used was obtained from the 
  [California Department of Education](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sp/ai/). The other two datasets showing the census information about the high schools in California were obtained from 
  [greatschools.org](https://www.greatschools.org/california) website.
